**Q: What happens if I forget to mark attendance?**  
A: One day will be automatically deducted from your leave balance at midnight. A WhatsApp notification will inform you.

**Q: Can I mark attendance for a previous day?**  
A: No. Attendance must be marked on the same day. Use Work Exception requests for missed days with valid reasons.

A: Contact HR immediately. They can manually adjust your attendance record. Your leave will be counted as sick leave.

**Q: Can I check in before 11:00 AM?**  
A: No. The system only allows check-ins from 11:00 AM onwards.

### 10.2 Work From Home Questions

A: You must wait until 6:00 PM to submit tasks. This ensures a full workday.

**Q: Does late arrival deduct leave?**  
A: No. Late arrival doesn't deduct leave, but it DOES reset your streak to 0.
